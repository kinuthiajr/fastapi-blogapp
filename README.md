# fastapi-blogapp
I am reading Microservice APIs: Using Python, Flask, FastAPI, OpenAPI and more by Jose Haro. To get hands on I built a blog app using FastAPI as I learn it.
Its an amazing book that introduces APIs and has an indepth explaination of designing APIs and also the microservice architecure.
